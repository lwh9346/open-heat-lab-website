bio: Qizhang's research interests lie in the intriguing phenomena of light-matter interactions and their applications in emerging photonic devices. During his PhD period, Qizhang worked on the rational deisgn approach of near-field radiative thermal diode, demonstrated ultrahigh rectification performance and explored its fundamental limit. Qizhang is now working at the University of Chicago as a postdoc where he focuses on utilizing electrochemistry to achieve dynamic optical and thermal metasurfaces.
