summary:
abstract: What are semiconductors for photons? What is quasicrystal? What are disordered materials? What is the key to producing photonic bandgaps? How can disordered materials providephotonic bandgaps? What are the advantages of disordered photonic bandgap materials? Progress in creating photonic bandgap materials through self-assembly processes. Moreoverhow to achieve nonlinear optics phenomena in soft condensed matters. This report will introduce some results of our research team in these fundamental fields of light-matterinteractions.
bio: Weining Man, graduated from the Gifted Youth Class of Jilin University and obtained herdoctorate from the Department of Physics at Princeton Wniversity, She was a postdoctorafellow at Princeton University and New York University. She is currently a tenured full professoin the Department of Physics and Astronomy at San Francisco State University. Her researchteam is engaged in the study of soft condensed matter physics, disordered materials, photonicbandgaps, and nonlinear optics. She invented the world's first three-dimensional photonic quasicrystal and fabricated and tested the world's first hyperuniform disordered photonicbandgap material. She has published in top scientific journals such as Nature, Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Sciences, Physical Review Letters, etc., and serves as a revieweland editor for various scientific iournals.
