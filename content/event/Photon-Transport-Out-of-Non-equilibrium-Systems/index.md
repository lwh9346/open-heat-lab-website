summary:
abstract: The usual fluctuational electrodynamics is based on a key assumption of local equilibrium through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, although globally, thesystem is not in thermal equilibrium. We develop the non-equilibrium Green's function method in which we can forgo local equilibrium. This can be realized in an electron nano-junction setup by connecting it to several thermal baths at differential temperatures or chemical potentials. Alternatively, we can modulate the system periodically in time. We discuss the consequence of such non-equilibrium states to energy and momentum transport.
bio: Jian-Sheng Wang graduated from Jilin University with a B.Sc in 1982. He joined the CUSPEA programme in 1982 and obtained Ph.D. (1987) in Physics from Carnegie-MellorUniversity. He had postdoctoral positions at Rutgers University (USA), HLRZ Juelich, and University of Mainz(Germany). His first job was at Hong Kong Baptist College from 1991 to 1993. Since 1993, he has been at National University oSingapore. He was in the Department of Computational Science, and now is a professor in the Department of Physics. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society (2005) for hisoutstanding contributions to the development of novel computer simulation algorithms and for their use in the study ofphase transitions and critical phenomena. He is well-known for the development of the cluster algorithm by the name Swendsen-Wana alaorithm for simuation of lsing and Potts models. His current interests move to quantum thermal transport, nonequilibrium Green's function methods, and near-field radiative heat transfer.
