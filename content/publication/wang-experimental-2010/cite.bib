 abstract = {Using a quasi-steady-state T-type probe, experimental evidence of the different behavior of the thermal impedance of a junction with different interstitial material (interposer) was presented. In the T-type probe, a short hot wire serves both as a heater and a thermometer, which is subjected to an alternating current, and a thermally infinite long test wire is attached to the midpoint of the hot wire with an interposer. The thermal impedance of the interposer was introduced, which was taken to be the product of the steady-state thermal resistance and a complex ratio function. A complete expression for the thermal impedance of the interposer was derived, and the effects of the radiation heat loss as well as the deviation of the contact junction position were theoretically estimated. A microscale Pt wire with two interposers was measured, including solidified platinum black and Apiezon N vacuum grease. Experimental results showed that the platinum black contact with high thermal effusivity served as a negative thermal impedance, while a positive thermal impedance was observed for the Apiezon N contact. The obtained thermal impedance of the Apiezon N contact could be equivalent to its thermal resistance, which was verified by measuring the thermal conductivity of a Cu wire using the steady-state T-type probe.},
