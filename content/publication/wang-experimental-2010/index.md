abstract: Using a quasi-steady-state T-type probe, experimental evidence of the different
  behavior of the thermal impedance of a junction with different interstitial material
  (interposer) was presented. In the T-type probe, a short hot wire serves both as
  a heater and a thermometer, which is subjected to an alternating current, and a
  thermally infinite long test wire is attached to the midpoint of the hot wire with
  an interposer. The thermal impedance of the interposer was introduced, which was
  taken to be the product of the steady-state thermal resistance and a complex ratio
  function. A complete expression for the thermal impedance of the interposer was
  derived, and the effects of the radiation heat loss as well as the deviation of
  the contact junction position were theoretically estimated. A microscale Pt wire
  with two interposers was measured, including solidified platinum black and Apiezon
  N vacuum grease. Experimental results showed that the platinum black contact with
  high thermal effusivity served as a negative thermal impedance, while a positive
  thermal impedance was observed for the Apiezon N contact. The obtained thermal impedance
  of the Apiezon N contact could be equivalent to its thermal resistance, which was
  verified by measuring the thermal conductivity of a Cu wire using the steady-state
  T-type probe.
