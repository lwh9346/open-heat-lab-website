abstract: We propose a mechanism to substantially rectify radiative heat flow by having
  one side of the thermal diode offering a large contrast in the local density of
  electromagnetic states, while the opposite side serving as a narrow bandpass filter
  that limits the transport to a desired spectral range. To demonstrate, we realize
  such a scenario by matching thin films of metal-to-insulator transition materials
  and polar dielectrics in the near field. By leveraging the distinct scaling behaviors
  of the local density of states with film thickness for metals and insulators, we
  theoretically achieve rectification ratios over 140, a 10-fold improvement over
  the state of the art, with nanofilms of vanadium dioxide and cubic boron nitride
  in the parallel-plane geometry at experimentally feasible gap sizes (âˆ¼100 nm). Our
  rational design offers relative ease of fabrication, flexible choice of materials,
  and robustness against deviations from optimal film thicknesses. We expect this
  work to facilitate the application of thermal diodes in solid-state thermal circuits
  and energy-conversion devices.
