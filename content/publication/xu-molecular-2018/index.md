abstract: Traditional polymers are both electrically and thermally insulating. The
  development of electrically conductive polymers has led to novel applications such
  as flexible displays, solar cells, and wearable biosensors. As in the case of electrically
  conductive polymers, the development of polymers with high thermal conductivity
  would open up a range of applications in next-generation electronic, optoelectronic,
  and energy devices. Current research has so far been limited to engineering polymers
  either by strong intramolecular interactions, which enable efficient phonon transport
  along the polymer chains, or by strong intermolecular interactions, which enable
  efficient phonon transport between the polymer chains. However, it has not been
  possible until now to engineer both interactions simultaneously. We report the first
  realization of high thermal conductivity in the thin film of a conjugated polymer,
  poly(3-hexylthiophene), via bottom-up oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD),
  taking advantage of both strong C=C covalent bonding along the extended polymer
  chain and strong π-π stacking noncovalent interactions between chains. We confirm
  the presence of both types of interactions by systematic structural characterization,
  achieving a near–room temperature thermal conductivity of 2.2 W/m·K, which is 10
  times higher than that of conventional polymers. With the solvent-free oCVD technique,
  it is now possible to grow polymer films conformally on a variety of substrates
  as lightweight, flexible heat conductors that are also electrically insulating and
  resistant to corrosion. Molecular engineering of intra- and interchain interactions
  transforms polymers into good heat conductors. Molecular engineering of intra- and
  interchain interactions transforms polymers into good heat conductors.
