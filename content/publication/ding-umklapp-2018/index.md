abstract: Since Peierls's pioneering work, it is generally accepted that phonon-phonon
  scattering processes consist of momentum-conserving normal scatterings and momentum-destroying
  Umklapp scatterings, and that the latter always induce thermal resistance. We show
  in this work that Umklapp scatterings are not necessarily resistiveâ€”no thermal resistance
  is induced if the projected momentum is conserved in the direction of heat flow.
  This distinction is especially important in anisotropic materials such as graphite
  and black phosphorous. By introducing a direction-dependent definition of normal
  and Umklapp scattering, we can model thermal transport in anisotropic materials
  using the Callaway model accurately. This accuracy is physically rooted in the improved
  description of mode-specific phonon dynamics. With the new definition, we predict
  that second sound might persist over much longer distances than previously expected.
