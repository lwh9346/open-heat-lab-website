abstract: Radiative thermal transport via the fluctuating electromagnetic near-field
  has recently attracted increasing attention due to its fundamental importance and
  its impact on a range of applications from data storage to thermal management and
  energy conversion. After a brief historical account of radiative thermal transport,
  we summarize the basics of fluctuational electrodynamics, a theoretical framework
  for the study of radiative heat transfer in terms of thermally excited propagating
  and evanescent electromagnetic waves. Various approaches to modeling near-field
  thermal transport are briefly discussed, together with key results and proposals
  for manipulation and utilization of radiative heat flow. Subsequently, we review
  the experimental advances in the characterization of both near-field heat flow and
  energy density. We conclude with remarks on the opportunities and challenges for
  future explorations of radiative heat transfer at the nanoscale.
