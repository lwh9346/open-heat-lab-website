abstract: This paper deals with the systematic and quantitative robustness analysis
  of solutions to the volume-to-point (VP) heat conduction optimization problem, including
  solutions by constructal theory (CT), bionic optimization (BO), simulated annealing
  (SA) as well as random solutions. The impacts of both load-induced and random failures
  are examined. All the solutions behave similarly during a failure. A tiny high-heat-flux-induced
  failure causes huge performance loss, which is the worst possible case. While the
  best case is a failure at positions of low heat flux, a large amount of which only
  causes a small performance loss. Random failure generally results in a loss roughly
  linear with failure amount, but sudden loss increase happens. Both intuitive and
  practical definitions of robustness are considered. Intuitively, a performance-robustness
  trade-off is seen for all the solutions, with poorer solutions being robuster. Practically
  things are different, with SA solutions both the best in performance and the robustest
  during a failure in the worst case. However, CT and BO solutions turn out to be
  robuster than SA solution in the best case, and CT solution may be more preferable
  in practice due to its regular geometry. With robustness taken into consideration,
  different solutions could be evaluated more comprehensively, the critical aspects
  concerning the practical realization of the solutions are also revealed, and furthermore
  the significance of robustness analysis in general VP problems is accentuated.
