 abstract = {Phonon transport in cubic boron nitride (c-BN) at elevated pressure in several tens GPa is potentially of interest for cooling high-power electronics. In this work, we study the pressure-dependent thermal conductivity (up to 20 GPa) of isotope-engineered c-BN by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with inputs only from ab initio calculations. Four boron isotope compositions are analyzed, including natural abundance, enriched 10B and 11B, and a roughly equal mixture of the two. In all cases, the thermal conductivity of c-BN increases linearly with pressure. Compared to isotope-enriched c-BN, the thermal conductivity of isotopically mixed c-BN is less sensitive to pressure variations since phonon-isotope scattering causes substantial thermal resistance yet is pressure independent. Based on mode-resolved analysis, the thermal conductivity enhancement is mainly attributed to the suppression of the aao absorption processes with transverse-acoustic phonons in the frequency range from 300 to 600 cmâ€“1, due to the synergistic effect between decreased coupling strength and phonon hardening. In addition, suppression of the aaa processes is also responsible for a slight increase in thermal conductivity. Our results are further supported by the frequency- and mean-free-path-dependent spectra of the thermal conductivity. This work provided a fundamental interpretation of pressure-dependent phonon transport in c-BN from a microscopic perspective.},
