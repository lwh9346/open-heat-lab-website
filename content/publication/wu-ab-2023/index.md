abstract: Phonon transport in cubic boron nitride (c-BN) at elevated pressure in several
  tens GPa is potentially of interest for cooling high-power electronics. In this
  work, we study the pressure-dependent thermal conductivity (up to 20 GPa) of isotope-engineered
  c-BN by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with inputs only from ab initio
  calculations. Four boron isotope compositions are analyzed, including natural abundance,
  enriched 10B and 11B, and a roughly equal mixture of the two. In all cases, the
  thermal conductivity of c-BN increases linearly with pressure. Compared to isotope-enriched
  c-BN, the thermal conductivity of isotopically mixed c-BN is less sensitive to pressure
  variations since phonon-isotope scattering causes substantial thermal resistance
  yet is pressure independent. Based on mode-resolved analysis, the thermal conductivity
  enhancement is mainly attributed to the suppression of the aao absorption processes
  with transverse-acoustic phonons in the frequency range from 300 to 600 cmâ€“1, due
  to the synergistic effect between decreased coupling strength and phonon hardening.
  In addition, suppression of the aaa processes is also responsible for a slight increase
  in thermal conductivity. Our results are further supported by the frequency- and
  mean-free-path-dependent spectra of the thermal conductivity. This work provided
  a fundamental interpretation of pressure-dependent phonon transport in c-BN from
  a microscopic perspective.
