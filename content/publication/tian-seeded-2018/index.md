abstract: Materials with high thermal conductivities are crucial to effectively cooling
  high-power-density electronic and optoelectronic devices. Recently, zinc-blende
  boron arsenide (BAs) has been predicted to have a very high thermal conductivity
  of over 2000 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature by first-principles calculations, rendering
  it a close competitor for diamond which holds the highest thermal conductivity among
  bulk materials. Experimental demonstration, however, has proved extremely challenging,
  especially in the preparation of large high quality single crystals. Although BAs
  crystals have been previously grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT), the growth
  process relies on spontaneous nucleation and results in small crystals with multiple
  grains and various defects. Here, we report a controllable CVT synthesis of large
  single BAs crystals (400–600 μm) by using carefully selected tiny BAs single crystals
  as seeds. We have obtained BAs single crystals with a thermal conductivity of 351 ± 21 W
  m−1 K−1 at room temperature, which is almost twice as conductive as previously reported
  BAs crystals. Further improvement along this direction is very likely.
