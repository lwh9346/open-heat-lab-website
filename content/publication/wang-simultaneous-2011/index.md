abstract: Combining the steady-state and quasi-steady-state T type probes, the longitudinal
  thermal conductivity and thermal effusivity of individual mesophase pitch-based
  carbon fiber heat treated at 2800 °C and 1000 °C have been measured from 100 K to
  300 K. The present method allows simultaneous measurements of thermal properties
  using the same instrument, by simply changing the applied direct current to alternating
  current. The specific heat is found to decrease with increasing heat-treatment temperature
  and to approach the value of graphite. The highly graphitized carbon fiber has a
  maximum thermal conductivity of 410 W · m−1 · K−1 at about 250 K, and its thermal
  diffusivity decreases with increasing temperature. Comparatively, the thermal conductivity
  of the fiber heat treated at 1000 °C is much smaller, with the peak shifting to
  high temperature due to a large defect density, and its thermal diffusivity is nearly
  temperature independent.
