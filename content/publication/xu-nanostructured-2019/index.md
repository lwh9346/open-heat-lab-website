abstract: Thermally conductive polymers can be used for advanced thermal management
  applications but the transport mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Here the authors
  report the synthesis of polyethylene films with high thermal conductivity, which
  is attributed to the amorphous regions of the nanofibers.
