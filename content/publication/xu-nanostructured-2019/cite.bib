 abstract = {Thermally conductive polymers can be used for advanced thermal management applications but the transport mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Here the authors report the synthesis of polyethylene films with high thermal conductivity, which is attributed to the amorphous regions of the nanofibers.},
