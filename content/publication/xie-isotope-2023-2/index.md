abstract: Isotopic dependence of the Casimir force is key to probing new physics and
  pushing novel technologies at the micro and nanoscale, but is largely unexplored.
  In 2002, an isotope effect of 10$^textrm−4$ was estimated for metals—orders of magnitude
  beyond the experimental resolution. Here, by employing the Lifshitz theory, we reveal
  a significant isotope effect of over 10$^textrm−1$ for polar dielectrics. This effect
  arises from the isotope-mass-induced line shift of the zone-center optical phonons
  and is insensitive to the linewidth. We perform numerical analyses on both the imaginary
  and real-frequency axes, and derive analytical formulas for predicting the isotope
  effect. The three-orders-of-magnitude difference between polar dielectrics and metals
  arises from the distinct isotopic dependence of the phonon and plasma frequencies.
  Our work opens up a new avenue for engineering forces at small scales and may also
  facilitate the quest for the fifth force of nature.
