abstract: We derive the fundamental limit to near-field radiative thermal rectification
  mediated by an intrinsic semiconductor film within the framework of fluctuational
  electrodynamics. By leveraging the electromagnetic local density of states, we identify
  ɛ′′H/ɛ′′L as an upper bound on the rectification magnitude, where ɛ′′H and ɛ′′L
  are the imaginary parts of the film permittivity at high and low temperatures, respectively.
  This bound is tight and can be approached regardless of whether the film is suspended
  or supported. For intrinsic silicon the limit can in principle exceed 109. Our work
  highlights the possibility of controlling heat flow as effectively as electric current,
  and offers guidelines to potentially achieve this goal.
