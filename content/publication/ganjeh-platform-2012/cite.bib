 abstract = {Parallelizing planar surfaces and manipulating them into close proximity with spatial separation of nanoscale dimensions is critical for probing phenomena such as near-field radiative heat transport and Casimir forces. Here, we report on a novel platform, with an integrated reflected light microscope, that is capable of parallelizing two planar surfaces such that the angular deviation is \textless6 μrad, while simultaneously allowing control of the gap from 15 μm down to contact with ∼0.15 nm resolution. The capabilities of this platform were verified by using two custom-fabricated micro-devices with planar surfaces, 60 × 60 μm2 each, whose flatness and surface roughness were experimentally quantified. We first parallelized the two micro-devices by using the developed platform in conjunction with a simple optical approach that relies on the shallow depth of field (∼2 μm) of a long working distance microscope objective. Subsequently, we experimentally tested the parallelism achieved via the optical alignment procedure by taking advantage of electrodes integrated into the micro-devices. Our measurements unambiguously show that the simple depth-of-field based optical approach enables parallelization such that the angular deviation between the two surfaces is within ∼500 μrad. This ensures that the separation between any two corresponding points on the parallel surfaces deviate by ∼30 nm or less from the expected value. Further, we show that improved parallelization can be achieved using the integrated micro-electrodes which enable surface roughness limited parallelization with deviations of ∼5 nm from parallelism.},
