abstract: Parallelizing planar surfaces and manipulating them into close proximity
  with spatial separation of nanoscale dimensions is critical for probing phenomena
  such as near-field radiative heat transport and Casimir forces. Here, we report
  on a novel platform, with an integrated reflected light microscope, that is capable
  of parallelizing two planar surfaces such that the angular deviation is textless6 μrad,
  while simultaneously allowing control of the gap from 15 μm down to contact with
  ∼0.15 nm resolution. The capabilities of this platform were verified by using two
  custom-fabricated micro-devices with planar surfaces, 60 × 60 μm2 each, whose flatness
  and surface roughness were experimentally quantified. We first parallelized the
  two micro-devices by using the developed platform in conjunction with a simple optical
  approach that relies on the shallow depth of field (∼2 μm) of a long working distance
  microscope objective. Subsequently, we experimentally tested the parallelism achieved
  via the optical alignment procedure by taking advantage of electrodes integrated
  into the micro-devices. Our measurements unambiguously show that the simple depth-of-field
  based optical approach enables parallelization such that the angular deviation between
  the two surfaces is within ∼500 μrad. This ensures that the separation between any
  two corresponding points on the parallel surfaces deviate by ∼30 nm or less from
  the expected value. Further, we show that improved parallelization can be achieved
  using the integrated micro-electrodes which enable surface roughness limited parallelization
  with deviations of ∼5 nm from parallelism.
