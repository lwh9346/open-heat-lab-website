abstract: Boron arsenide, considered an ideal semiconductor, inevitably introduces
  arsenic defects during crystal growth. Here, we develop a uniﬁed neural network
  interatomic potential with quantum-mechanical precision that accurately describes
  phonon transport properties in both perfect and defective boron arsenides. Through
  molecular dynamics simulations, we quantitatively explore the degree of phonon localization
  in boron arsenide caused by arsenic vacancies. We conﬁrm that this localization
  primarily affects vibration modes within the frequency range of 2.0–4.0 THz, which
  is a challenge for conventional ﬁrst-principles approaches. In addition, we examine
  the ﬂuctuation of the heat ﬂux autocorrelation function, which reveals the extent
  of phonon phase disruption resulting from arsenic voids and lattice anharmonicity
  from a more fundamental perspective. Our study highlights the applicability of molecular
  dynamics simulations in conjunction with neural network interatomic potential for
  defective systems, laying the theoretical groundwork for phonon engineering in real
  semiconductor crystals.
