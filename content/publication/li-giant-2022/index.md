abstract: Rectiﬁcation of heat ﬂow via a thermal diode is not only of fundamental
  interest, but can also enable a range of novel applications in thermal management
  and energy conversion. However, despite decades of extensive research, large rectiﬁcation
  ratios of practical importance have yet to be demonstrated. Here, we theoretically
  achieve giant rectiﬁcation ratios (3 to almost 5 orders of magnitude) by leveraging
  nearﬁeld radiative thermal transport between two parallel planes. Guided by a rational
  design approach centering on the electromagnetic local density of states (LDOS),
  we employ a thin ﬁlm of an intrinsic semiconductordsuch as silicondas one terminal
  of our radiative thermal diodes, which provides the necessary nonlinearity and a
  substantial LDOS contrast as the temperature bias is ﬂipped. For the other terminal,
  we explore two kinds of materials which either serve as a narrowband or a broadband
  ﬁlter, both capable of converting the large LDOS contrast into giant thermal rectiﬁcation.
  We further consider representative multilayer conﬁgurations in order to block backside
  radiation and improve mechanical stability. All the designs are expected to perform
  well over a wide range of ﬁlm thicknesses, gap sizes, and temperatures. Our work
  offers an opportunity for realizing thermal diodes with unprecedented rectiﬁcation
  ratios.
