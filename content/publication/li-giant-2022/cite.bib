 abstract = {Rectiﬁcation of heat ﬂow via a thermal diode is not only of fundamental interest, but can also enable a range of novel applications in thermal management and energy conversion. However, despite decades of extensive research, large rectiﬁcation ratios of practical importance have yet to be demonstrated. Here, we theoretically achieve giant rectiﬁcation ratios (3 to almost 5 orders of magnitude) by leveraging nearﬁeld radiative thermal transport between two parallel planes. Guided by a rational design approach centering on the electromagnetic local density of states (LDOS), we employ a thin ﬁlm of an intrinsic semiconductordsuch as silicondas one terminal of our radiative thermal diodes, which provides the necessary nonlinearity and a substantial LDOS contrast as the temperature bias is ﬂipped. For the other terminal, we explore two kinds of materials which either serve as a narrowband or a broadband ﬁlter, both capable of converting the large LDOS contrast into giant thermal rectiﬁcation. We further consider representative multilayer conﬁgurations in order to block backside radiation and improve mechanical stability. All the designs are expected to perform well over a wide range of ﬁlm thicknesses, gap sizes, and temperatures. Our work offers an opportunity for realizing thermal diodes with unprecedented rectiﬁcation ratios.},
