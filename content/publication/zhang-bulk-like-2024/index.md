abstract: We investigate phonon transport in consecutively twisted multilayer graphene
  (CTMG) via atomistic simulations, assuming the same twist angle between any adjacent
  layers. Intriguingly, the calculated temperature drop be­ tween each two layers
  along the cross-plane direction in CTMG appears nearly identical, indicating an
  ill-defined Kapitza length. Moreover, the bulk-like thermal resistance increases
  with rising temperature. Both phenomena suggest that heat conduction in CTMG more
  closely resembles that in bulk materials as compared to layered materials with an
  individual mismatched interface, such as twisted multilayer graphene (TMG). This
  peculiar behavior originates from the unique nanostructure of CTMG. First, the common
  twist angle creates a consistent charge distribution at each interface, leading
  to a higher binding energy and reduced mismatch of the phonon density of states
  across the interface, and therefore a more uniform temperature drop. Further, the
  continuum of interfaces induces strong scattering of low-energy acoustic phonons
  generated by emission processes at the in­ terfaces, which results in a temperature
  dependence opposite to that of TMG. Our findings enable a better un­ derstanding
  of phonon transport in twisted multilayer graphene, and may also facilitate the
  exploration of other interface-engineered van der Waals nanostructures.
