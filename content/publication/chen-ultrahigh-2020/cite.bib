 abstract = {A cool way to use isotopes
Thermal management of electronics requires materials that can efficiently remove heat. Several promising materials have been found recently, but diamond remains the bulk material with the highest thermal conductivity. Chen et al. found that isotopically pure cubic boron nitride has an ultrahigh thermal conductivity, 75% that of diamond. Using only boron-11 or boron-10 allows the crystal vibrations that carry heat to move more efficiently through the material. This property could be exploited for better regulating the temperature of high-power devices.

Materials with high thermal conductivity (κ) are of technological importance and fundamental interest. We grew cubic boron nitride (cBN) crystals with controlled abundance of boron isotopes and measured κ greater than 1600 watts per meter-kelvin at room temperature in samples with enriched 10B or 11B. In comparison, we found that the isotope enhancement of κ is considerably lower for boron phosphide and boron arsenide as the identical isotopic mass disorder becomes increasingly invisible to phonons. The ultrahigh κ in conjunction with its wide bandgap (6.2 electron volts) makes cBN a promising material for microelectronics thermal management, high-power electronics, and optoelectronics applications.
Isotopically pure cubic boron nitride has a thermal conductivity almost as high as that of diamond.
