abstract: A cool way to use isotopes Thermal management of electronics requires materials
  that can efficiently remove heat. Several promising materials have been found recently,
  but diamond remains the bulk material with the highest thermal conductivity. Chen
  et al. found that isotopically pure cubic boron nitride has an ultrahigh thermal
  conductivity, 75% that of diamond. Using only boron-11 or boron-10 allows the crystal
  vibrations that carry heat to move more efficiently through the material. This property
  could be exploited for better regulating the temperature of high-power devices.
  Science, this issue p. 555 Materials with high thermal conductivity (κ) are of technological
  importance and fundamental interest. We grew cubic boron nitride (cBN) crystals
  with controlled abundance of boron isotopes and measured κ greater than 1600 watts
  per meter-kelvin at room temperature in samples with enriched 10B or 11B. In comparison,
  we found that the isotope enhancement of κ is considerably lower for boron phosphide
  and boron arsenide as the identical isotopic mass disorder becomes increasingly
  invisible to phonons. The ultrahigh κ in conjunction with its wide bandgap (6.2
  electron volts) makes cBN a promising material for microelectronics thermal management,
  high-power electronics, and optoelectronics applications. Isotopically pure cubic
  boron nitride has a thermal conductivity almost as high as that of diamond. Isotopically
  pure cubic boron nitride has a thermal conductivity almost as high as that of diamond.
