abstract: Graphite gets a second sound Between the two extremes of ballistic and diffusive
  lattice thermal transport is the potential for an exotic wave-like state known as
  second sound. Huberman et al. used fast, transient thermal grating measurements
  to show the existence of second sound in graphite between 85 and 125 kelvin (see
  the Perspective by Shi). Previous observations of second sound have been rare, confined
  to isotopically pure materials at very low temperatures. The observation of second
  sound in graphite is likely due to its layered nature, suggesting that this thermal
  transport mode may be accessible in other two-dimensional materials. Science, this
  issue p. 375; see also p. 332 Wavelike thermal transport in solids, referred to
  as second sound, is an exotic phenomenon previously limited to a handful of materials
  at low temperatures. The rare occurrence of this effect restricted its scientific
  and practical importance. We directly observed second sound in graphite at temperatures
  above 100 kelvins by using time-resolved optical measurements of thermal transport
  on the micrometer-length scale. Our experimental results are in qualitative agreement
  with ab initio calculations that predict wavelike phonon hydrodynamics. We believe
  that these results potentially indicate an important role of second sound in microscale
  transient heat transport in two-dimensional and layered materials in a wide temperature
  range. Second sound was observed in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Second sound
  was observed in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.
