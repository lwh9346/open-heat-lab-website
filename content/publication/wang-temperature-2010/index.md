abstract: Temperature dependence of thermal resistance of a bare joint between two
  crossed platinum wires was measured using a quasi steady-state T-type probe in the
  temperature range of 100–300K. The thermal resistance was found to decrease rapidly
  as the temperature increased from 100 to 200K, then the trend slowed down, which
  could be explained by the temperature behaviors of the hardness and elastic modulus
  of platinum. Considering both the microscopic and macroscopic thermal resistances,
  the calculated results fitted well with the experimental data, and the obtained
  conductance–load exponent was also within the reasonable range.
