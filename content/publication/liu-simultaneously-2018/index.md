abstract: Through first-principles calculations, the phonon-limited transport properties
  of cubic boron-V compounds (BP, BAs, and BSb) are studied. We find that the high
  optical phonon frequency in these compounds leads to the substantial suppression
  of polar scattering and the reduction of intervalley transition mediated by large-wave-vector
  optical phonons, both of which significantly facilitate charge transport. We also
  discover that BAs simultaneously has a high hole mobility (2110cm2/Vs) and electron
  mobility (1400cm2/Vs) at room temperature, which is rare in semiconductors. Our
  findings present insight into searching high mobility polar semiconductors, and
  point to BAs as a promising material for electronic and photovoltaic devices in
  addition to its predicted high thermal conductivity.
