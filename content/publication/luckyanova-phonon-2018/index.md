abstract: Nondiffusive phonon thermal transport, extensively observed in nanostructures,
  has largely been attributed to classical size effects, ignoring the wave nature
  of phonons. We report localization behavior in phonon heat conduction due to multiple
  scattering and interference events of broadband phonons, by measuring the thermal
  conductivities of GaAs/AlAs superlattices with ErAs nanodots randomly distributed
  at the interfaces. With an increasing number of superlattice periods, the measured
  thermal conductivities near room temperature increased and eventually saturated,
  indicating a transition from ballistic to diffusive transport. In contrast, at cryogenic
  temperatures the thermal conductivities first increased but then decreased, signaling
  phonon wave localization, as supported by atomistic Green»ôs function simulations.
  The discovery of phonon localization suggests a new path forward for engineering
  phonon thermal transport. Anderson localization in phonon heat conduction is observed
  in GaAs/AlAs superlattices with ErAs nanodots. Anderson localization in phonon heat
  conduction is observed in GaAs/AlAs superlattices with ErAs nanodots.
