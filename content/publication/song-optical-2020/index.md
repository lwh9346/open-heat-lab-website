abstract: The ultrahigh thermal conductivity of cubic boron arsenide (BAs) makes it
  a promising material for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics. Here,
  we report measured optical properties of BAs crystals, including the complex dielectric
  function, refractive index, and absorption coefficient in the ultraviolet, visible,
  and near-infrared wavelength range. The data were collected at room temperature
  using spectroscopic ellipsometry and transmission and reflection spectroscopy. We
  further calculated the optical response using density functional theory and many-body
  perturbation theory, considering quasiparticle and excitonic corrections. The computed
  values for the direct and indirect bandgaps (4.25 eV and 2.07 eV) agree well with
  the measured results (4.12 eV and 2.02 eV). Our findings pave the way for using
  BAs in future electronic and optoelectronic applications that take advantage of
  its demonstrated ultrahigh thermal conductivity and predicted high ambipolar carrier
  mobility.
