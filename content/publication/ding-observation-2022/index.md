abstract: 'Second sound refers to the phenomenon of heat propagation as temperature
  waves in the phonon hydrodynamic transport regime. We directly observe second sound
  in graphite at temperatures of over 200 K using a sub-picosecond transient grating
  technique. The experimentally determined dispersion relation of the thermal-wave
  velocity increases with decreasing grating period, consistent with first-principles-based
  solution of the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation. Through simulation, we reveal
  this increase as a result of thermal zero sound—the thermal waves due to ballistic
  phonons. Our experimental findings are well explained with the interplay among three
  groups of phonons: ballistic, diffusive, and hydrodynamic phonons. Our ab initio
  calculations further predict a large isotope effect on the properties of thermal
  waves and the existence of second sound at room temperature in isotopically pure
  graphite.'
