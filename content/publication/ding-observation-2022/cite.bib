 abstract = {Second sound refers to the phenomenon of heat propagation as temperature waves in the phonon hydrodynamic transport regime. We directly observe second sound in graphite at temperatures of over 200 K using a sub-picosecond transient grating technique. The experimentally determined dispersion relation of the thermal-wave velocity increases with decreasing grating period, consistent with first-principles-based solution of the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation. Through simulation, we reveal this increase as a result of thermal zero sound—the thermal waves due to ballistic phonons. Our experimental findings are well explained with the interplay among three groups of phonons: ballistic, diffusive, and hydrodynamic phonons. Our ab initio calculations further predict a large isotope effect on the properties of thermal waves and the existence of second sound at room temperature in isotopically pure graphite.},
