abstract: As a foundational concept in many-body physics, electron–phonon interaction
  is essential to understanding and manipulating charge and energy flow in various
  electronic, photonic, and energy conversion devices. While much progress has been
  made in uncovering how phonons affect electron dynamics, it remains a challenge
  to directly observe the impact of electrons on phonon transport, especially at environmental
  temperatures. Here, we probe the effect of charge carriers on phonon heat transport
  at room temperature, using a modified transient thermal grating technique. By optically
  exciting electron-hole pairs in a crystalline silicon membrane, we single out the
  effect of the phonon–carrier interaction. The enhanced phonon scattering by photoexcited
  free carriers results in a substantial reduction in thermal conductivity on a nanosecond
  timescale. Our study provides direct experimental evidence of the elusive role of
  electron–phonon interaction in phonon heat transport, which is important for understanding
  heat conduction in doped semiconductors. We also highlight the possibility of using
  light to dynamically control thermal transport via electron–phonon coupling.
