abstract: Active control of heat flow is of both fundamental and applied interest
  in thermal management and energy conversion. Here, we present a fluctuational electrodynamic
  study of thermal radiation between twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), motivated by
  its unusual and highly tunable plasmonic properties. We show that near-field heat
  flow can vary by more than 10-fold over only a few degrees of twist, and observe
  a larger variation with increasing chemical potential and decreasing temperature.
  Further, we identify special angles leading to heat flow extrema, which are dictated
  by the Drude weight in the intraband optical conductivity of TBLG, and are roughly
  linear with the chemical potential. As the twist angle decreases, we observe multiband
  thermal transport due to the increasing role of interband transitions, in analogy
  to monolayer graphene in a magnetic field. We also briefly discuss the effect of
  a small angular deviation and a substrate, which are experimentally relevant. Our
  findings are understood via the surface plasmons in TBLG, and highlight its potential
  for manipulating radiative heat flow.
