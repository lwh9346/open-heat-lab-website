abstract: Dissipation of ultrahigh heat fluxes is critical to modern electronic chips
  as they become ever more compact and powerful. Here, by employing a systematic numerical
  study, we present a highly-efficient embedded single-phase water-cooled silicon
  heat sink featuring a manifold with interdigitated inlets and outlets and jet microchannels
  with sawtooth side walls. Compared to straight channels, the sawtooth walls reduce
  blockage of the jet inflow and therefore the pressure drop. Meanwhile, the sawtooth
  profile helps suppress the large recirculation region around the jet inlet and generate
  small vortices near the channel walls which facilitate fluid mixing and enhance
  heat exchange. This simultaneous enhancement of heat transfer and reduction of pressure
  drop leads to some of the highest cooling efficiencies. In particular, for a 3 ×
  3 mm2 chip at a temperature rise of 60 K, dissipation of heat fluxes over 2100 W
  cm−2 is possible with a pumping power of about 1.3 W cm−2. For heat fluxes around
  1000 W cm−2, the coefficient of performance can reach beyond 20,000. In addition
  to the high performance, our heat sink can in principle be manufactured via standard
  silicon microfabrication technology.
