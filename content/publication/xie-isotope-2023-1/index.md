abstract: Guided by a rational design approach centering on the electromagnetic local
  density of states (LDOS), we explore the potential of isotopically engineering radiative
  thermal diodes for enhanced rectification with a focus on the near field. Based
  on fluctuational electrodynamics, we theoretically demonstrate that for thermal
  diodes pairing thin films of intrinsic silicon (i-Si) and lithium hydride (LiX),
  the rectification ratio can increase by over six times with varying isotopic compositions.
  This is because by leveraging the isotope-induced shift and broadening of the surface
  phonon polaritons in LiX, more LDOS contrast provided by i-Si can be effectively
  converted into thermal rectification. Moreover, we show that such improvement is
  fairly robust, as evidenced by the prediction of over 20% rectification enhancement
  across a wide physical and geometric parameter space. Finally, inspired by insights
  from the i-Si-based thermal diodes, we propose general guidelines for implementing
  isotope engineering in the design of practical devices, which are further illustrated
  via representative diodes employing vanadium dioxide and silicon carbide as the
  active materials. Our work highlights the efficacy of isotopes in boosting the performance
  of radiative thermal diodes, which also holds promise for broader applications such
  as thermal transistors, thermal switches, and thermophotovoltaics.
