 abstract = {Guided by a rational design approach centering on the electromagnetic local density of states (LDOS), we explore the potential of isotopically engineering radiative thermal diodes for enhanced rectification with a focus on the near field. Based on fluctuational electrodynamics, we theoretically demonstrate that for thermal diodes pairing thin films of intrinsic silicon (i-Si) and lithium hydride (LiX), the rectification ratio can increase by over six times with varying isotopic compositions. This is because by leveraging the isotope-induced shift and broadening of the surface phonon polaritons in LiX, more LDOS contrast provided by i-Si can be effectively converted into thermal rectification. Moreover, we show that such improvement is fairly robust, as evidenced by the prediction of over 20% rectification enhancement across a wide physical and geometric parameter space. Finally, inspired by insights from the i-Si-based thermal diodes, we propose general guidelines for implementing isotope engineering in the design of practical devices, which are further illustrated via representative diodes employing vanadium dioxide and silicon carbide as the active materials. Our work highlights the efficacy of isotopes in boosting the performance of radiative thermal diodes, which also holds promise for broader applications such as thermal transistors, thermal switches, and thermophotovoltaics.},
