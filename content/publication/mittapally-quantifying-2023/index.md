abstract: Recent measurements of near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between
  objects separated by nanometer-sized vacuum gaps have revealed that thermal radiation
  at the nanoscale is remarkably distinct from far-field thermal radiation and can
  exceed the blackbody radiation limit by orders of magnitude. Given the technological
  relevance of thin films, there remains a significant need to experimentally explore
  how such films influence NFRHT. Here, we report direct measurements of the thickness-dependence
  of NFRHT between planar nanofilms of magnesium fluoride (thickness ranging from
  20 to 500 nm) performed using microfabricated devices and a custom-developed nanopositioner.
  These results directly demonstrate for the first time that nanofilms can enhance
  thermal radiation up to 800-fold above the blackbody limit and are as effective
  as bulk materials when nanoscale gaps have dimensions smaller than the film thickness.
  Finally, calculations based on fluctuational electrodynamics show good agreement
  with the measured gap-size dependence of the heat transfer coefficient for films
  of all thicknesses and provide physical insight into the observed dependence. The
  experimental techniques and insights reported here pave the way for systematically
  exploring novel thin films for near-field thermal and energy systems.
