abstract: Radiative heat transfer rates that exceed the blackbody limit by several
  orders of magnitude are expected when the gap size between plane parallel surfaces
  is reduced to the nanoscale. To date, experiments have only realized enhancements
  of ∼100 fold as the smallest gap sizes in radiative heat transfer studies have been
  limited to ∼50 nm by device curvature and particle contamination. Here, we report
  a 1,200-fold enhancement with respect to the far-field value in the radiative heat
  flux between parallel planar silica surfaces separated by gaps as small as ∼25 nm.
  Achieving such small gap sizes and the resultant dramatic enhancement in near-field
  energy flux is critical to achieve a number of novel near-field based nanoscale
  energy conversion systems that have been theoretically predicted but remain experimentally
  unverified.
