abstract: In the hydrodynamic regime, phonons drift with a nonzero collective velocity
  under a temperature gradient, reminiscent of viscous gas and fluid flow. The study
  of hydrodynamic phonon transport has spanned over half a century but has been mostly
  limited to cryogenic temperatures (∼1 K) and more recently to low-dimensional materials.
  Here, we identify graphite as a three-dimensional material that supports phonon
  hydrodynamics at significantly higher temperatures (∼100 K) based on first-principles
  calculations. In particular, by solving the Boltzmann equation for phonon transport
  in graphite ribbons, we predict that phonon Poiseuille flow and Knudsen minimum
  can be experimentally observed above liquid nitrogen temperature. Further, we reveal
  the microscopic origin of these intriguing phenomena in terms of the dependence
  of the effective boundary scattering rate on momentum-conserving phonon–phonon scattering
  processes and the collective motion of phonons. The significant hydrodynamic nature
  of phonon transport in graphite is attributed to its strong intralayer sp2 hybrid
  bonding and weak van der Waals interlayer interactions. More intriguingly, the reflection
  symmetry associated with a single graphene layer is broken in graphite, which opens
  up more momentum-conserving phonon–phonon scattering channels and results in stronger
  hydrodynamic features in graphite than graphene. As a boundary-sensitive transport
  regime, phonon hydrodynamics opens up new possibilities for thermal management and
  energy conversion.
