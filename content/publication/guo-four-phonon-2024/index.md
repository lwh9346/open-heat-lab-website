abstract: Among two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides, molybdenum
  ditelluride (MoTe2) is of great interest to achieving unique functionalities in
  diverse electronic, photonic, and phononic devices. Despite extensive studies over
  the past decade, the thermal transport properties and mechanisms of MoTe2 remain
  largely unclear. Here, we grow few-layer (7L, 10L, and 17L) single-crystalline 2H–MoTe2
  and measure their in-plane thermal conductivities using an optothermal Raman technique.
  The room-temperature values range from 4 to 9 W m−1 K−1, substantially lower than
  theoretical predictions considering only three-phonon scattering. By employing first-principles
  calculations and machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal
  that four-phonon scattering could suppress the thermal conductivity of 2H–MoTe2
  by 80%, which agrees with experimental measurement and is mainly attributed to the
  flexural acoustic modes. Thickness-dependent suppression is observed owing to the
  varying reflection symmetry. Our work highlights higher-order phonon-phonon interactions
  in 2D materials and offers guidance for the thermal design of emerging devices.
