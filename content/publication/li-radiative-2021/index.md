abstract: Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) support propagating waves with arbitrarily
  large wavevectors over broad spectral ranges, and are uniquely valuable for engineering
  radiative thermal transport in the near field. Here, by employing a rational-design
  approach based on the electromagnetic local density of states, we demonstrate the
  ability of HMMs to substantially rectify radiative heat flow. Our idea is to establish
  a forward-biased scenario where the two HMM-based terminals of a thermal diode feature
  overlapped hyperbolic bands which result in a large heat current, and suppress the
  reverse heat flow by creating spectrally mismatched density of states as the temperature
  bias is flipped. As an example, we present a few high-performance thermal diodes
  by pairing HMMs made of polar dielectrics and metal-to-insulator transition materials
  in the form of periodic nanowire arrays, and considering three representative kinds
  of substrates. Upon optimization, we theoretically achieve a rectification ratio
  of 324 at a 100-nm gap, which remains greater than 148 for larger gap sizes up to
  1 Âµm over a wide temperature range. The maximum rectification represents an almost
  1000-fold increase compared with a bulk diode using the same materials, and is twice
  that of state-of-the-art designs. Our work highlights the potential of HMMs for
  rectifying radiative heat flow, and may find applications in advanced thermal-management
  and energy-conversion systems.
