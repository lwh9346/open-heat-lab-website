abstract: 'Moving the heat aside with BAs Thermal management becomes increasingly
  important as we decrease device size and increase computing power. Engineering materials
  with high thermal conductivity, such as boron arsenide (BAs), is hard because it
  is essential to avoid defects and impurities during synthesis, which would stop
  heat flow. Three different research groups have synthesized BAs with a thermal conductivity
  around 1000 watts per meter-kelvin: Kang et al., Li et al., and Tian et al. succeeded
  in synthesizing high-purity BAs with conductivities half that of diamond but more
  than double that of conventional metals (see the Perspective by Dames). The advance
  validates the search for high-thermal-conductivity materials and provides a new
  material that may be more easily integrated into semiconducting devices. Science,
  this issue p. 575, p. 579, p. 582; see also p. 549 Conventional theory predicts
  that ultrahigh lattice thermal conductivity can only occur in crystals composed
  of strongly bonded light elements, and that it is limited by anharmonic three-phonon
  processes. We report experimental evidence that departs from these long-held criteria.
  We measured a local room-temperature thermal conductivity exceeding 1000 watts per
  meter-kelvin and an average bulk value reaching 900 watts per meter-kelvin in bulk
  boron arsenide (BAs) crystals, where boron and arsenic are light and heavy elements,
  respectively. The high values are consistent with a proposal for phonon-band engineering
  and can only be explained by higher-order phonon processes. These findings yield
  insight into the physics of heat conduction in solids and show BAs to be the only
  known semiconductor with ultrahigh thermal conductivity. Boron arsenide has an ultrahigh
  thermal conductivity, making it competitive with diamond for thermal management
  applications. Boron arsenide has an ultrahigh thermal conductivity, making it competitive
  with diamond for thermal management applications.'
