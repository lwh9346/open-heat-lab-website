abstract: Based on the new concept of thermal mass which refers to the equivalent
  mass of the thermal energy in an object according to Einstein's mass-energy relation,
  the kinetic energy and potential energy of thermal mass as well as its dissipation
  were introduced to establish the Lagrange equations in heat conduction. The results
  show that Fourier's law is equivalent to the Lagrange equations with negligible
  inertia forces. The application of Lagrange equations in heat conduction makes it
  possible to unify the treatment of heat transfer and mechanics as well as electrics
  through the method of analytical mechanics.
