abstract: Thermal resistance induced by long-range electron-phonon interaction is
  often considered negligible. Here, by combining ab initio calculations with analytical
  modeling, we show that the scattering rate of acoustic phonons due to the electron-phonon-induced
  dipole (EPID) interaction varies asymptotically as the reciprocal of the phonon
  wavevector (∝q–1), and surpasses the short-range deformation-potential scattering
  as the wavevectors reduce to tens of reciprocal centimeters. This strong EPID coupling
  can significantly suppress the thermal conductivity in wurtzite zinc oxide, which
  originates from the absence of a mirror plane perpendicular to the c-axis that breaks
  the inversion symmetry of the out-of-plane vibrational modes. In contrast, such
  an effect does not occur in the zinc-blende gallium arsenide because no piezoelectric
  field can be generated along the three principal axes. This work highlights the
  effect of centrosymmetry breaking on tailoring phonon transport in polar semiconductors.
