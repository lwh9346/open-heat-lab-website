abstract: Boron arsenide (BAs) has recently emerged as a promising semiconductor for
  both heat dissipation and device fabrication in future electronics and optoelectronics.
  In particular, a proper band gap value (∼1.85 eV) combined with a large carrier
  mobility makes BAs a potential photoelectrode material for solar energy harvesting.
  In this work, we employ spin-polarized density functional theory calculations to
  investigate the possibility of using surface-functionalized BAs as a photocathode
  for solar-driven CO2 reduction. With a focus on the BAs (110) facet in aqueous solution,
  we first examine the band-edge positions and show a large thermodynamic driving
  force for CO2 reduction by photoexcited electrons from the conduction band. We further
  study the catalytic activity of BAs functionalized with a cocatalyst, pyridine (Py),
  by describing the reaction pathway of a hydride-transfer process from adsorbed 2-pyridinide
  (2-PyH–*, a Py-derived catalytic intermediate) to CO2. We find that both the 2-PyH–*
  formation and the CO2 reduction step are thermodynamically and kinetically favorable
  and predict that Py-functionalized BAs is a promising candidate for heterogeneous
  CO2 photoreduction.
